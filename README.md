# Codeforces-Solutions

## Context
I started solving Codeforces problems over the summer. Started with 800 star problems and I only started pushing my code to GitHub approaching the end of 800 star problems. I find Codeforces really fun.
Hope to transition to Leetcode or Project Euler once I get a lot better.

## Languages Used
I am currently using Python and C to solve these problems. C for my school curriculum and Python as a hobby.
